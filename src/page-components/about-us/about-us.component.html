  <h2>My Motivation</h2>
  <p>It turns out I am not a bad software developer. I didn't find this out until my 40s, but better late than never.</p>
  <p>If you read my origin story, I get into that I just didn't believe that card counting really worked, after my coding skills took off, I had a new tool to analyse what had just been a theory. I realized I could prove it with simulations.</p>
  <p>I didn't realize then the amount of analyzable data that could be generated from those simulations. But I don't want to get ahead of myself</p>

  <h2>My origin Sory</h2>
  <h3>I know that reading some guy's origin story is as interesting a looking at some guys's vacation pictures, but if you are curious, here it is.</h3>
  <p>When I was 21, making $5 an hour, I played a lot of blackjack at low limits. I was the quintessential ploppie. I just loved blackjack, it made sense to me.</p>
  <p>Back then my analytical side was overshowed by my magical thinking side.</p>
  <p>That was a long time ago, a lot of life happened and one day a "mathy" friend told me about a book, by Ben Mezrich that he thought I would like. I read Bringing Down the House, I read his next book "Busting Vegas" and then I read every blackjack book I could get my hands on. I learned basic strategy and went to the casinos ... and I sucked at counting cards.</p>
  <p>It's not that I wasn't good at it, and I definately was not. It's not that I was so completely obvious, and I'm not talking about with my bet spread, my head was bobbing and weaving trying to see every card as soon as it came out. It's not that, in my state the max bet was $5, which was soon to change to a max bet of $100 which I knew would be waaaaay over any bet that I would ever make.</p>
  <p>It was that I didn't believe it worked. I read all the books, I did know the theory, but when it came down to it it seemed like I was just as likely to get dealt a 16 against a 10 whatever the count was.</p>
  <p>I put it back on the shelf until 21 the movie came out. That time I went to dealers school, I only wanted to be a dealer to get into the inner circle of professional players. I would have been a hell of a dealer, but dealers were forced to alse do roulette whuch I hated and af ter a single interview, which started out great but ended in flames, the urge left me completely for a good decade or more.</p>
  <p>My wife once read an article about a regular guy from Michagan came up with a system to beat the lottery. The guy reminded her so much of me that she took a bunch of screen shots of te article and texted them to me just as I was about to board a plane. I read them and I did feel the connection with the guy, but nothing came of it ... until they made a movie about the guy.</p>
  <p>After we watched "Bill and Marge Go Large", I told my wife that I if I put y mind to it, I could beat blackjack. Things had changed for the better in our lives by then. While I had spent many many years in blue collar jobs, a decade as a cab driver and turned that into a Limo Business with a doomed business model, I finally got a job as a software developer that got us out of the rat race.</p>
  <p>My approach to number systems like blackjack had changed, when I told my wife "I could beat blackjack", I didn't mean I was thinking about trying again, I meant I thought I could test the theory out by writing code to do a simulation.</p>
  <p>My wife knew that I had long fought off my "get rich quick" mentality, but she also was well aware of my analytical side. It surprise the hell out of me though when she said, "Well then you should go for it."</p>
