  <h2>My Motivation</h2>

  <p class="paragraph">
    It turns out I am not a bad software developer. I didn't find this out until my 40s, but better late than never.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    If you read my origin story, I get into how I just wan't convinced that card counting really worked, after my coding skills grew though, I could apply my skill set to analysing the game. I realized I could prove or disprove cardcounting with simulations.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    I think I was just looking for a yes or no answer to card counting. I didn't realize then the amount of analyzable data that could be generated from those simulations. But I don't want to get ahead of myself
  </p>

  <h2>My Origin Story</h2>

  <h3>
    Reading some random, mediocre blackjack player's origin story is about as interesting as looking at his last vacation pictures, but if you are curious, here it is.
  </h3>

  <p class="paragraph">
    I was 21, making $5 an hour, gambling had become legal in my state just a few years earlier and my big sister introduced me to blackjack. It was my kind of game, I instantly "understood" and I played it alot, becoming the quintessential ploppie. I loved blackjack, it made sense to me, and I was good at it, whatever that even meant.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Back then my analytical side was overshowed by my magical thinking side. In fact, this was just one of many "get rich quick" fantasies I've had.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Many years later, a "mathy" friend told me about a book, by Ben Mezrich, that he thought I would like, "Bringing Down the House". By then, my blackjack phase was in the past, a lot of life happened including a wife and 2 kids. Blackjack had fallen way down the priority list, but not off of it completely.
  </p>
  
  <p class="paragraph">
    I read "Bringing Down the House" as well as Ben Mezrich's next book "Busting Vegas" followed by any and every blackjack book I could get my hands on. I thought blackjack was fun before, but now I knew with just a little more brain power and discipline it was beatable. I went back to the casinos ... and I sucked at counting cards.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    It took a while, but this new interest in the game eventually faded. It's not that I wasn't good at card counting, and I definately was not (and I knew it). It's not that, in my state the max bet was $5 and the min was $3; I knew it would be changing to $100 max soon. It's not that it was so completely obvious that I was up to something with my head bobbing and weaving trying to see every card as soon as it came out.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    It was that after doing it for a little while, I just couldn't convince myself that it actually worked. The books, the theory, whatever, when it came down to it, it seemed like I was just as likely to get dealt a 16 against a 10 whatever the count was high as when it was low, or that the dealer would show a six, flip over a 5 and then pull a face card. It seemed like nothing changed and I was disenchanted.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    I put it back on the shelf where it sat until 21 the movie came out. My zeal was renewed and that time I went to dealers school. I wanted to be a dealer because I figured, as a dealer, I could make my way into the secret inner circle of a professionsal card counting team and live the "secret agent" / "sex, drugs and rock and roll" lifestyle in the movie.
  </p>
    
  <p class="paragraph"> 
    I would have been a great blackjack dealer, but dealers were forced to also "deal" roulette, which had no appeal to me, and after a single interview, which started out great but ended in flames, the zeal left me completely for a good decade or more.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    During that time my wife read an article about how a regular guy from Michagan came up with a system to beat the lottery. The guy reminded her so much of me that she took a bunch of screen shots of the article and texted them to me just as I was about to board a plane. I read them on the flight and I did feel the connection with the guy, but nothing came of it ... until they made a movie about the guy.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Things had changed for the better in our lives by this time. While I had spent many many years in blue collar jobs, a decade as a cab driver and turned that into a Limo Business with a doomed business model, I finally got a job as a software developer that got us out of the rat race. After we watched "Bill and Marge Go Large", I casually told my wife that if I put my mind to it, I was sure I could beat blackjack. It was sort of left unsaid that I wasn't actually considering going back down that rabbit hole. 
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    Despite my best attempts to prevent it, I had matured by then. My approach to number systems like blackjack had changed, when I told my wife "I could beat blackjack", I didn't mean it suddenly made sense again, It meant I thought I could test the theory out by writing code and doing simulations.
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    My wife was well aware of my suppressed "get rich quick" mentality, but she also was well aware of my analytical, "mathy" side. It surprise the hell out of me though when she said, "Well, then you should go for it."
